# VibiKey

[![Build](https://github.com/BlackCatOfficialytb/vibikey/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BlackCatOfficialytb/vibikey/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A free, open-source Vietnamese input method (bộ gõ tiếng Việt) with an
EVKey-style interface.

- **UI/UX:** Python + PySide6
- **Core (conversion + system keyboard hook):** C
- **Input methods:** Telex and VNI (word-level, correct tone placement,
  full uppercase support: Ê, Ô, Ơ, Ă, Đ, ...)
- **Languages:** English / Tiếng Việt (switchable in-app)

> Tiếng Việt: xem [`docs/README_vi.md`](docs/README_vi.md).

## Why verify before you trust a build

**Only run VibiKey builds you can verify.** As a community guideline (not a
license term — VibiKey is GPLv3, which permits any distribution including
commercial), we strongly discourage obfuscated/packed binaries and ask that
builds be independently verifiable before they are shared.

Here is why this matters. UniKey is the best-known Vietnamese IME. Its
**official** website is **unikey.org**. A separate site, **unikey.vn**,
is *not* the official project and has been reported to distribute UniKey
builds bundled with unwanted/possibly-malicious software, without a valid
digital signature. Because an input method sees every keystroke you type,
a tampered build is extremely dangerous.

VibiKey's guideline: a shared build should come from published source, be
reproducible, ship checksums, and ideally be reproduced by at least one
independent party before it is offered for download. If a VibiKey download
is packed, unsigned, or you can't match its checksum to a reproducible
build from source — **do not run it.**

## Quick start (from source)

Requirements: Python 3.11+, a C compiler (MSVC or GCC/Clang).

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install PySide6-Essentials pynput
python run_ui.py
```

The C core (`vibikey_core.dll` / `libvibikey_core.so`) is built
automatically on first run if a compiler is available.

## Features

- System-wide typing into any app (Notepad, browsers, chat, ...).
- Tray icon: left-click toggles Vietnamese/English; double-click opens
  settings.
- Global toggle hotkey (default `Ctrl+Shift`).
- Conflict detection for other Vietnamese IMEs (UniKey/EVKey/OpenKey/...).
- Single-instance guard (prevents doubled keystrokes).

## Building a distributable

```powershell
# PyInstaller (default) or Nuitka; add -OneFile for a single exe
.\build.ps1 -Tool pyinstaller
.\build.ps1 -Tool nuitka -OneFile
```

```bash
./build.sh --tool pyinstaller
./build.sh --tool nuitka --onefile
```

If you plan to share the build with others, follow the verification
requirements in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and the notes in [`docs/`](docs/).

## Documentation

- [`docs/README_vi.md`](docs/README_vi.md) — Vietnamese README.

## License

VibiKey is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3 (or later)**.
See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

**Why GPLv3:** VibiKey includes code reverse-engineered from EVKey, which is
based on **UniKey**. UniKey is released under the GPL, so VibiKey — as a
derivative work — must also be GPL. (See the note in `LICENSE`.) This also
means VibiKey's source must always stay available; please keep builds
reproducible and ship source alongside any binary you share.

**Trust note:** because an input method sees everything you type, only run
builds you can verify from source. See the verification guidance above.

**Modified versions (GPLv3 §7 additional terms):** if you distribute a
modified version, you must rename it, change its logo/icon, and mark it as
different from the original. You may not use the "VibiKey" or
"BlackCatOfficial" names or logos to brand/endorse modified or derived
products without prior written permission. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).
